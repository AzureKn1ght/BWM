# BMW Compound

Project abandoned. Suspected going to rug anyway.

# ENV Variables 
You will need to create a file called *.env* in the root directory, copy the text in *.env.example* and fill in the variables 


# How to Run 
You could run it on your desktop just using [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) in your terminal. However, on a production environment, it is recommended to use something like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to run the processes to ensure robust uptime and management.
